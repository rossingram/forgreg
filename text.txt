Black plate on a balck table
Are you willing and able
To assist in an emergency
Evacuation policy
—
My whole life feels like a chore
And now I'm just bored
I can't feel
Anything anymore
—
It's nice to miss you
—
When it came to what I love I found less to cry about
—-
She left this morning just past 5
a sleepless night under the sky
A night of stories, laughs and cries
What will I do without her
She played a song and sang about love
Wonder if I'm who she's thinking of
I still hear her voice and feel her kiss
What will I do without her
When will I get to hold her
You will never get a chance to see
Who you are when you're with me
most beautiful things come from
Some of the darkest places
She's had a lot to do this year
Just be with me again my dear
I'm not just a name on your list
You're my favorite flavor
—
Cause I’m taking all the exits
To get away from all my exes
To clear a road to you
--
My favorite thing about you is that you just don't try
—
Sometimes you have to cut to relieve the pressure
—
This is the best I can do
And it sucks thanks to you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh fuck me? NO! Fuck you.
In the style of bowling for soup

CHORUS
I’ve been down, in a hole
nothin’ round, nothin’ whole
i’ve been waiting, for you, to come back around
i’ve been up, I’ve been down,
that last one, more around, and and now when i think of that choice, i just want to disappear.
BRIDGE
i told you, to leave in December
by now, it feels like forever
i left you with no hope: “you don’t need to go home, but you can’t, stay here.” and now when i think of that choice, i want to disappear.
—
Because bad decisions are warm reminders of my time with you
—
Cause girls don’t like the skinny boy’s like us
—
Collective delusion is just reality
A song about living in LA
—
The slower I pull away the more interested you are
—
Well maybe the loudest people need the most quiet
—
Who knows what you need, not even you
—
Violently lazy
—
BO so bad you can hear it
—
I’m semi just kinda over being alone
—
The words that I’m saying aren’t what I’m meaning, but they are what I’m saying
